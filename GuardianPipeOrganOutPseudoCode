# + some others that I don't know about

# set up any serial port communication we'll need

# using some type of shift register or port thingy to get more pins
# so initialize that

# Read any incoming MIDI messages (events) over USB
# looking for note on, note off messages

# Our organ will have 32 notes starting at middle C (C4) and going up to G6
# Each time a note on value is detected, write the pin connected to that note's solonoid high
# Each time theres a note off value, write the pin low

# there will be transistors in between every solonoid to supply the correct voltage
