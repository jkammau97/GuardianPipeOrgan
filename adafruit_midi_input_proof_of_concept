### cpx-expressive-midi-controller v1.2
### CircuitPython (on CPX) MIDI controller using the seven touch pads
### and accelerometer for modulation (cc1) and pitch bend
### Left button adjusts octave (switch left) or semitone (switch right)
### Right button adjusts scale, major or chromatic
### Switch right also disables pitch bend and modulation

### Tested with CPX and CircuitPython and 4.0.0-beta.5

### Needs recent adafruit_midi module
